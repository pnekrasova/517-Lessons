## How to add an existing project to GitHub using GitHub Desktop

If you have an existing project that you want to manage with GitHub, GitHub Desktop makes the process simple and straightforward. Follow these steps to get your project onto GitHub:

### 1. Install GitHub Desktop
If you haven’t already, download GitHub Desktop from [GitHub's official site](https://github.com/) and install it on your computer.

### 2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in
If you’re not logged in, you’ll be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account credentials. Enter your username and password.

### 3. Add your existing project
- Click on 'File' in the menu bar.
- 'Choose Add Local Repository' from the dropdown menu.
- In the dialog box that appears, click 'Choose...' and navigate to the folder containing your existing project. Select the folder and click 'Add Repository'.

### 4. Publish your repository
- Once your project is added to GitHub Desktop, you’ll see it listed in the app. Click the 'Publish repository' button at the top of the window.
- Provide a name for your repository in the 'Name' field. You can use the default name or enter a new one.
  
*Optionally, add a description for the repository.*

- To publish a public repository, deselect 'Keep this code private'. If you want to publish the repository under an organization, select the organization from the 'Organization' dropdown menu. To publish to your personal account, select 'None'.
- Click 'Publish Repository' to upload your project to GitHub.
